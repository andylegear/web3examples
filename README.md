# Web3 Examples

This project is a comprehensive suite of Ethereum-based tools and features, designed for developers who want to interact with the Ethereum blockchain. It includes basic and payable contracts, wallet creation and decryption, transaction handling, and a token contract. Each feature is encapsulated in its own directory, making the project modular and easy to navigate.

## Files in this project

### `basicContract/Counter.sol`

This Solidity file contains the code for a basic contract. It's a simple counter contract that increments, decrements, and returns the current count. This contract serves as a basic example of how to write and structure a contract in Solidity.

### `checkBalance/`

This directory contains the HTML and CSS files for a feature that checks the balance of a wallet. It provides a user-friendly interface for users to input their wallet address and see their current balance. The balance is displayed in Ether, and the interface updates in real-time.

### `createWallet/`

This directory contains the HTML and CSS files for a feature that creates a new wallet. It provides a user-friendly interface for users to create a new Ethereum wallet. The interface guides the user through the process, generating a private key and a public address.

### `decryptWallet/`

This directory contains the HTML and CSS files for a feature that decrypts a wallet. It provides a user-friendly interface for users to input their encrypted wallet and password to access their wallet. The interface ensures the security of the user's information and provides error handling for incorrect passwords.

### `LICENSE`

This file contains the license information for this project. It's important to read this to understand the permissions, conditions, and limitations on the use of this project's code. The project is licensed under the MIT license, allowing for commercial use, modification, distribution, and private use.

### `payableContract/AndyTokenPayable.sol`

This Solidity file contains the code for a payable contract. It's a contract that can receive Ether payments. The contract includes functions for handling incoming payments and keeping track of the total amount of Ether received.

### `sendPayableTransaction/`

This directory contains the HTML and CSS files for a feature that sends a payable transaction. It provides a user-friendly interface for users to send Ether to a payable contract. The interface includes error handling for insufficient funds and invalid contract addresses.

### `sendTransaction/`

This directory contains the HTML and CSS files for a feature that sends a transaction. It provides a user-friendly interface for users to send Ether from one wallet to another. The interface includes error handling for insufficient funds and invalid addresses.

### `tokenContract/AndyToken.sol`

This Solidity file contains the code for a token contract. It's a contract for a custom token called "AndyToken". The contract includes functions for minting new tokens, transferring tokens between addresses, and checking the balance of an address.
